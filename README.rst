It's the MostlyOverengineeredSudokuSolver!

MOSS is *not* a brute-force solver; instead, it implements techniques a human would use. MOSS may *not* be able to solve all Sudokus (yet).

This project is mainly a playground for various Java-related techniques such as streams, so its focus is *not* completeness or even adequacy, let alone performance.
