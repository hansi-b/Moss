It's the MostlyOverengineeredSudokuSolver!

MOSS is *not* a brute-force solver; instead, it implements techniques a human would use. 

This project is mainly a playground for various Java-related techniques, so ...

+ its focus is *not* completeness or even adequacy.
+ there are *no* guarantees beyond what the tests show to be working.
+ MOSS may *not* be able to solve all Sudokus (yet).
